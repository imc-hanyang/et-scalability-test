The *.csv files in this archive contain the raw data that can be decoded to view the values or restored to Cassandra.

The process of viewing the values is as follows:
    1. Extract last column (values)
    2. Convert to bytes from hex string
    3. Convert bytes to readable string (e.g., utf8 conversion)
